ISP 1 is an independent study project where I created a polygonal fish and used transformations only to move it. It moves in 3D space moving in all possible directions

ISP 2 is an indpendent study project where I created a method to encrypt text. I encrypted the text using an arbitrarily large key matrix transformation. Then I hid the encrypted text in all the Blue pixels of every RGB pixel. This was also obscured with noise across the each every pixel. The key is also hidden inside the image.
